# Console Catalog of Bob Ross's Data

Welcome to the Bob Ross API ðŸŽ¨! This API is filled with data about the colors he used, air dates, and subject matter! I have also used `chalk` to create a better user experience within the console.

## Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js 
- PostgreSQL

## Challenges

Examples: One Color `curl "http://localhost:3000/episodes?colors=Sap%20Green"` or for multple colors `curl "http://localhost:3000/episodes?colors[]=Sap%20Green&colors[]=Titanium%20White"`

You will see on the terminal running the Express server this:
